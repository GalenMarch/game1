        // My game will be played on a black background
        //
        // A set of "live" blocks controlled by the player:
        // The player will control a single block that can move left
        // and right across the bottom of the playing field.
        //
        // A set of "dead" blocks that are no longer plater controlled:
        // The object of my game is to dodge randomly-generated blocks as they
        // fall from the top of the playing field.  In addition, the player 
        // has three lives.  Each time the player is hit with a block, the player
        // controlled block "dies" and remains in the spot where it was struck, reducing
        // the amount of space the player has to dodge blocks later in the game.  This 
        //will ideally add more challenge to the game as it progresses.
        //
        // A scoring system:
        // For each second the player remains alive, ten points will be awarded
        //
        // A win or fail state:
        // The game is lost when the player loses all three lives (i.e. when the player
        // is hit with falling blocks three times)
        //
        // A control mechanism:
        // The player will use the left and right arrow keys to control their block
    }
